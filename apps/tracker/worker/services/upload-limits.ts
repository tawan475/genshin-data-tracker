/**
 * Upload quotas per user (migration 0018), on top of the per-file caps
 * (GOOD_LIMITS in @gdt/shared, checked while parsing) and the per-minute rate
 * limits (wrangler.jsonc):
 * - a daily quota (UTC day) of new snapshots and newly stored bytes, counted
 *   in `user_upload_days` by the import's own write batch: 429
 *   `daily_upload_limit`, with Retry-After at the next UTC midnight;
 * - a storage quota: the stored sections of all the user's accounts plus
 *   their artifact catalog chunks (snapshot rows' small `meta` is left out:
 *   summing it would read every snapshot row on every import): 413
 *   `storage_quota`.
 * The defaults are UPLOAD_LIMIT_DEFAULTS; a `site_settings` row overrides one
 * for everybody, and `users.storage_quota` one user's storage quota.
 *
 * Only an upload that is about to store something is checked: a re-upload of
 * a stored capture, or the same inventory seen again, stores nothing and is
 * never refused. The usage is read in the import's first batch, so checking
 * and counting add no D1 round trip. A limit refuses uploads once it is
 * reached: the upload that crosses it is stored whole (one file, at most
 * 10 MB before compression), so a concurrent pair can pass it by a file.
