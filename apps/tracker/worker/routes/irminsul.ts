/**
 * A signed-in irminsul's routes, under /api/irminsul (README "Sign in from
 * irminsul"). `Authorization: Bearer <access>` only: a browser's cookies are
 * no use here, and these tokens are no use anywhere else (lib/irminsul-auth).
 *
 * - `GET /whoami`: who is signed in and where uploads go (the verify-key
 *   answer's fields, plus `user` and `configUrl`: the page that changes the
 *   target; irminsul never changes it).
 * - `POST /import`: the same body, limits and answers as `import-by-key`
 *   (routes/public, services/upload-as): uid mode is a user key's routing,
 *   account mode an account key's. 20 uploads a minute per session.
 *
 * Both read the session row in the one D1 round trip they make before the
 * import (an import key's lookup costs the same): an ended session is 401
 * `session_revoked`, a suspended user 403 `account_suspended`, blocked uploads
 * 403 `uploads_blocked`, as with keys.
