/**
 * Routes authenticated by an import key rather than a session.
 * Paths and shapes are irminsul's wire contract (`irminsul/src/monitor.rs`):
 * the key arrives in `x-import-key`; any 2xx is success; 401/403 makes
 * irminsul re-verify its key; `verify-key` is read from the top level.
 * Responses only ever gain fields (irminsul ignores unknown ones): an import
 * answers with `warnings` when the file's UID is not the account's, and with
 * the `account` it went to.
 *
 * Two kinds of key: an account's own key uploads to that account; a user's
 * key uploads to the user's account whose UID is the file's `gi_player.uid`,
 * making that account on the first upload of a new UID.
 *
 * Limits (irminsul shows the message of any refusal): 20 uploads a minute
 * per key (KEY_IMPORT_LIMITER; irminsul uploads at most every few seconds,
 * and only when the game sent new data), 60 verifications a minute per key,
 * 20 unknown keys a minute per IP; per file GOOD_LIMITS (422) and the
 * owner's daily and storage quotas (429 / 413, services/upload-limits.ts).
