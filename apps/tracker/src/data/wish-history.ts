/**
 * Wish history on the page: the stored chunks decoded, and per banner the
 * pity counts and 50/50 outcomes.
 *
 * Rules (as paimon.moe counts them):
 * - Pity: pulls since the last 5★ (or 4★), that pull included. A 5★ does
 *   not reset the 4★ count. 301 and 400 share one count.
 * - Character Event (301 + 400): a 5★ that is the banner's featured
 *   character won the 50/50 (or was guaranteed after a loss); any other 5★
 *   lost it, and the next 5★ is guaranteed. The same for 4★ with the three
 *   featured 4★ characters.
 * - Weapon Event (302): a 5★ that is one of the two featured weapons won
 *   (75/25) or was guaranteed; a standard 5★ lost, the next 5★ is a
 *   featured one. Which of the two (Epitomized Path) is not tracked: the
 *   history doesn't say which weapon was charted.
 * - Chronicled, Standard, Beginners': pity only.
 * - Capturing Radiance (5.0+) is not modelled: the history can't tell a
 *   radiance win from a plain one. What is counted is how many 50/50s were
 *   lost in a row.
 * Featured items come from banner data adapted from paimon.moe (MIT,
 * wish-banners.json, apps/tracker/scripts/wish-data.mjs). A pull outside
 * every known banner (one newer than the data) gets no outcome, and the
 * guarantee after it reads as unknown.
