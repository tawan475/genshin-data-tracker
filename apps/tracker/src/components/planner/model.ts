/**
 * The Planner page's model: stored targets joined with the newest snapshot
 * (current levels, talents, weapons; a state set by hand where it is ahead,
 * see hand-edits.ts) and the planner data, each goal's cost memoised
 * (`createRequirementCache`). Costs, totals, conversions and
 * estimates come from `@gdt/game-data` (planner-math, planner-goals,
 * planner-estimate); this file only shapes them for the page. Pure
 * functions; the view keeps them in computed()s.
 *
 * Goal ids: `character:Key`, `custom:<id>` (a custom character, see
 * custom-character.ts), `weapon:Key:Owner:<id>` (each weapon goal has its
 * own id, so a weapon can have several) and `item:Key`.
 *
 * A character goal may also want artifacts (artifact-goals.ts): no cost,
 * ticked from what the capture shows it wearing; a card is done when its
 * levels, talents and weapons are and its artifacts too.
